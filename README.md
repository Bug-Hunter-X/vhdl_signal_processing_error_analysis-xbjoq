This repository demonstrates a common VHDL coding error related to signal assignment and clock edge detection within processes. The `bug.vhdl` file contains code that exhibits the error, while `bugSolution.vhdl` provides a corrected version.  The error involves improper handling of signal updates within a clocked process, which can lead to incorrect data output or simulation inconsistencies.  The solution showcases best practices for signal assignment and clock edge detection in VHDL to prevent such issues.
